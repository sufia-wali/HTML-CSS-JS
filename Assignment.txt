1. What is the internet? Explain in your own words.

Ans : - The internet is a global network of computers and other devices connected to each other through
communication channels, allowing people to access, exchange and share information and resources, such as
text, images, videos, etc., anywhere in the world. It operates on the principles of standard protocols
and technologies like the World Wide Web (WWW), email, and others, that allow seamless interoperability
and connectivity.


2. What is a web browser? Explain in your own words.

Ans: -A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and display content
on the internet. It acts as a client for the World Wide Web, connecting to servers on the internet to
request and receive web pages, images, videos, and other forms of digital media. Some of the popular
web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and others.
A browser also provides features like bookmarking, history, and security, making it a crucial tool for
accessing the internet and navigating the World Wide Web.


3. What is a browser engine? Explain in your own words.

Ans : - A browser engine is the core component of a web browser that is responsible for rendering and
displaying web pages on a user's device. It takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and converts it into
a visual representation that users can interact with. The engine is also responsible for handling and
processing network requests, such as loading web pages and fetching resources such as images and videos.


4. What is a static site? Explain in your own words.

Ans : - A static website is a type of website that contains fixed, unchanging content that is delivered
to the user as is, without any dynamic processing on the server. It consists of a set of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files that are stored on a web server and delivered to the client as they are, without any
additional processing.Static sites are simple, fast, and cost-effective. They are a good choice for sites
 with limited dynamic content and low traffic, as they do not require a lot of server resources.


5. What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.

 Ans : - A dynamic website is like a program or a software application - it can show different information
based on user actions and input, and can change over time.It uses server-side scripting languages like
PHP, Ruby, Python, or others, to dynamically generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is sent to the client
for rendering. This allows the content of a dynamic site to change based on user input, database information,
or other factors, providing a more interactive and personalized experience for the user.Dynamic sites are more
complex than static sites.
